            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1929 </strong>Birth
                    <p>- Born in Atlanta, Georgia</p>
                </li></br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1935 </strong>Early Childhood
                    <p>
                        - Started school at the age of six. King had to attend a school for black children, Younge Street Elementary School,
                        while his close playmate went to a separate school for white children only.
                        At the age of twelve he was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for seventh grade.
                    </p>
                </li></br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1942 </strong>Adolescence
                    <p>
                        - In his adolescent years, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the "racial humiliation" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure in the segregated South.
                        In high school, King became known for his public-speaking ability, with a voice which had grown into an orotund baritone.
                        He proceeded to join the school's debate team.
                        In his junior year, King gave his first public speech during an oratorical contest, sponsored by the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World in Dublin, Georgia.
                    </p>
                </li></br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1948 - 1955 </strong>Academic life
                    <p>
                        - At the age of 15, King passed the entrance examination and was enrolled at the university.
                        By the time he was nineteen he graduated from Morehouse College with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in sociology in 1948.
                        In 1951, King began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University and 
                        received his Ph.D. degree in 1955.
                    </p>
                </li></br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1957 </strong>SCLC
                    <p>
                        - King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). 
                        The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform.
                    </p>
                </li></br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1963 </strong>March on Washington
                    <p>
                        - King, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the "Big Six" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. 
                        The march originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S.
                        The march made specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; 
                        a $2 minimum wage for all workers (equivalent to $17 in 2019); and self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee.
                        Here he delivered a 17-minute famous speech, later known as "I Have a Dream". His speech came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory.
                        The March, and especially King's speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers in the United States and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
